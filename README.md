1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
   No, I would not use a unit test to test the the “message” feature of a messaging application, because this process involves interactions between multiple components but unit tests are only designed to test components in isolation.
   
2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
   Yes, I would use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application, because this feature is a specific, isolated functionality that is ideal for unit testing and they are quick to run and can be executed frequently.
